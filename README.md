## **How to Run**  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Aadithyanaadi/CODSOFT.git
   cd CODSOFT 
   ```  
2. Run the Python scripts using the command line:  
   ```bash  
   python <script_name>.py  
   ```  

---

## **Prerequisites**  
- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.  
- Basic understanding of command-line navigation.  

---

## **Project-Specific Notes**  
### **Data Storage**  
- The **To-Do List** and **Contact Book** applications save their data in JSON files (`tasks.json` and `contacts.json`) to maintain persistence across sessions. Ensure these files are present in the same directory as the scripts.  
- If the JSON files do not exist, they will be created automatically upon the first save operation.  

### **Code Style**  
- Follows PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.  
- Designed with modularity for easy maintenance and scalability.
